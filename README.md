üöÄ Overview
Expense Splitter Pro is a sophisticated, single-page application built from the ground up to provide an intuitive and elegant solution for tracking shared costs. As a final semester BCA student, this project was undertaken to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of modern front-end architecture, state management, and the creation of a polished, production-quality user experience.

The application features a "glassmorphism" inspired design, is fully responsive, and leverages local storage for data persistence, ensuring a seamless user session. The entire development process, including debugging complex environmental and animation bugs, showcases advanced problem-solving skills and a commitment to high-quality code.

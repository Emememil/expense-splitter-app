# Expense Splitter Application

A feature-rich, single-page application built from the ground up to simplify expense management for groups. This app provides an intuitive and elegant solution for tracking shared costs, calculating debts, and settling up, all wrapped in a premium, responsive user interface.

## üöÄ Overview

Welcome to my Expense Splitter App! This project showcases my ability to build a complex, interactive, and user-friendly web application using modern front-end technologies. It demonstrates a deep understanding of state management in React, component-based architecture, and creating a polished user experience with fluid animations and a clean, glassmorphism-inspired design.

As a final semester BCA student, I'm passionate about building practical tools that solve real-world problems. This project was a deep dive into creating a professional-grade product, from initial concept to final deployment.
